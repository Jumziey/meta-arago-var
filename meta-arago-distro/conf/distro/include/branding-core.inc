# Set extra preferences based on the product branding (AM-SDK, MC-SDK, etc)
# Examples could be different PREFERRED_PROVIDER or PREFERRED_VERSION
# As well as some other configurable aspects or variables
# Please avoid creating multiple versions of the same brand, if possible
# The policy is for the "Core" brand to be the default,
# hence this file is mostly empty and used as a template

# Auto rev important packages to pick up latest

#SRCREV_pn-u-boot-ti-staging = "${AUTOREV}"
